# Intro
   SimplyCode! project is cross-platform open source code editor with No syntax correction and No highlighting! <br>
   For all programming history lovers with infinite customisation and C-orientated auto-tabulation tool. <br>
   Written in JavaScript, a home for some JS libraries and works offline even better than as online tool. <br>

# Motivation 
   Code editors now weight more and more, but even less comfortable in some cases. <br>

   Now you can make yourself any file better! Project contribution note: <br>
   Before changing multiple files make sure it is worth so <br>
   Before adding new tools please discuss with community <br>
   When changing library, create new folder with the new library version <br>
   follow this rule: <br>
     small change = + 0.01 <br>

     reissue = + 1 <br>
